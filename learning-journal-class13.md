Today I worked on the busmall project and got my chart working correctly with
my click data.  I also got the save to local storage part working but still need
to work on retrieving from local storage.  With some help from Eddie, I now
understand the "execution path" part of my messy code a bit better.  I still
need to work at better code modularity so that I can write code thats easier
to understand.
