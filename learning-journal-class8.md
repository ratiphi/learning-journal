Today I learned a lot about forms and events.  I understood the lecture pretty
well and I finished my lab fairly quickly.  After that I stuck around and helped
out as many people as I could.  I am excited to learn more and look forward to
my next big ah-ha moment.  I need to rework some of my code from the last few
days to clean it up a bit.  Also want to get much better with CSS...
