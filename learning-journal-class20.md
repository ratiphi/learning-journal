Friday morning we ran into a bit of a snag.  Vitaliy and Jonah had both been working on refining our transitioning title on the start page, without really talking to each other.  Jonah was stressing about changing his code the morning of the presentation and Vitaliy was upset that his work wasnt going to be used.  I got to practice some conflict resolution.  I had them merge Vitaliy's code into a non master branch on Jonah's code base so we could attempt to merge them without screwing up the original.  Other than a small bug, it worked.
