Today I learned WAY more about how functions and arrays work.  
The lab work today really helped to cement the ideas of functions, parameters,
arguments, and using an array index.  I also had a huge ah-ha moment
during Brian's wireframe build out demo.  That really helped me to understand
how complex webpage layouts are achieved with CSS.
