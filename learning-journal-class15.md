Today we started to plan out our group project.  I learned that planning a project is the most important part, so that we are all on the exact same page.  We each had different takes on our group's project and we needed to combine them into one.  Also, our differing ideas on the project was awesome because we each brought something different to the table and we got to pick out the best bits of our ideas and combine them into a better overall project goal.
