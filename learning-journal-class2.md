Today I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The biggest thing I learned today was how each of these interact with each other.
Back in the early 2000s, when I was working on my Bachelor's degree,
I took classes on web design and programming.  But these classes never really
linked the two together for me.  I never really understood completely how
they interacted with each other.  I knew what CSS was roughly, but I didn't
know how it interacted with HTML.  I knew how JavaScript code worked but
I didn't really understand how it interacted with HTML.  I guess this was my
first big "ah ha! moment" in Code Fellows.  I look forward to many more :)
