Thursday we had all of the pieces of the app made, we just needed to merge our code together.  I learned a lot about making my code work with someone else's code.  I had done all of my work in a separate .js file from Jonah.  I had made a bunch of functions that needed to be called to save the game to local storage and retrieve it from local storage.  I did not realize it when I wrote these functions, but they needed to be called in Jonah's code.  It was a very big ah-ha moment for me :)
