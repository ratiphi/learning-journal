Today I learned the basics of adding stuff to an HTML document with JavaScript.  
I have done a bit of programming before and a bit of HTML before, but I have
never really gotten to the point where I can combine the 2 into 1.  At one point
I had an issue with my code where I needed to back track a bit to add in a
counter for the random cookie generator.  It was a great feeling being able to
look at the problem, with just a bit of help from a TA, and being able to solve
it and see my code print to the HTML properly.
